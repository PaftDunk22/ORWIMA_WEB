            "Runick" is an archetype of Main Deck Spells and Extra Deck Fusion Monsters introduced in Deck Build Pack: Tactical Masters. <br>
            The archetype is themed after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology"target="_blank">Norse mythology</a> and 
            action <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game"target="_blank">RPG</a> video games, seen from a first person perspective.  <br>
            The artwork of several of their cards also have monsters and characters seen in the art of the cards in 
            the <a href="https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Generaider"target="_blank">"Generaider"</a> archetype, implying a strong lore connection between the two.

        <div class="core">
            The Core of the Deck revolves around playing enough Runick Spells to start with 2 in your 5-card opening hand. <br>
            The usual count is 17 Quick-Play Spells + 2 Field Spells in a 40 Card Deck. <br>
            Extra Deck Monsters are variant dependant but the most important Monsters are <a href="archetype.html#hugin">Hugin</a> and <a href="archetype.html#geri">Geri</a> as they help you keep the Field Spell in rotation. <br>
